<p><b>The File Information Tool Set</b> (FITS) identifies, validates and
extracts technical metadata for a wide range of file formats.

<p>
It acts
as a wrapper, invoking and managing the output from several other open
source tools. Output from these tools are converted into a common
format, compared to one another and consolidated into a single XML
output file. FITS is written in Java and is compatible with Java 1.6
or higher.
