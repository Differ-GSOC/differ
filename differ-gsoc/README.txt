This sample generates graphical tooltips for a table that references image files. (Like the one used on the DIFFER project page.) The tooltips show a preview of the current image item being pointed to in the table.

This project was built in ~ Eclipse JEE Juno SR2 + Tomcat 7.0 + Vaadin 7.0.5
 
Important Note: This sample references images directly within the project folder. So if you are going to alter the project structure, make sure those changes are reflected in the code. (The image folder path is set on Line 56 of the Main_UI.java source file.)
