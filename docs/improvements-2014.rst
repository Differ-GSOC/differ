**result of comparion** can be in **other** than **text format**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

    It could be great to have a comparison report in `html`.
    Or in `pdf`. Report can be done using JasperReport or Docbook or something similar.

Significant properties **processing** is **slow**
----------------------------------------------------------------

::
    
    There are a lot of properties that program must collects and normalizes.
    They are stored in ArrayList structure. It is often necessary to select given properties 
    by its own name.

    Implementing some kind of index by property name must speed up an aplication.
    At least ArrayHash by property name could help.
    
Calling of **external java extractors** is **slow**
---------------------------------------------------------------------

::

    Metadata extractors that are written in java can be called in running JVM 
    calling some class methods. It must speed up an application a lot.

Interface for an application using **RabbitMQ** or **Apache ActiveMQ**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::
    
    The intention is to run the external processes in a separate 
    JVM to be more robust and to offer standard integration pattern.

Add a way to **exclude properties** that user does not need
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

    A user will choose properties that will be shown.
