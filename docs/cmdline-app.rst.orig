Program usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
::

<<<<<<< HEAD
   validates image, prints readable report to stdout and saves it into file image.drep
   c:\> differ.bat --save-report image.jpg

   loads report from file image.drep and prints it to stdout
   c:\> differ.bat --load-report image.drep

   validates images and compares it and prints report to stdout 
   and save it into file image1.drep and image2.drep
   c:\> differ.bat --save-report image1.jpg image2.jpg

   validates images and compares it and prints report readable way to stdout 
   The program will print properties regarding to a file properties.lst
   c:\> differ.bat --load-properties properties.lst image1.jpg image2.jpg

   The program will print properties in a format that can be used to choose properties to print in the future
   c:\> differ.bat --show-properties


Example output: One image validation
=======
   validates image, prints report readable way at stdout and saves it into file image.drep
   c:\> differ.bat --save-report image.jpg

   loads report from file image.drep and prints it readable way at stdout
   c:\> differ.bat --load-report image.drep

   validates images and compares it and prints report readable way at stdout 
   and save it into file image1.drep and image2.drep
   c:\> differ.bat --save-report image1.jpg image2.jpg

   validates images and compares it and prints report readable way at stdout 
   The program will print properties regarding to a file properties.lst
   c:\> differ.bat --load-properties properties.lst image1.jpg image2.jpg

   The program will print properties in a format that can be used to choose properties to print in future
   c:\> differ.bat --show-properties

<<<<<<< HEAD
   You can see many more examples in the /docs/ folder 

.. note::
   
   Developers and unix users can use the helpful bash scripts in the folder /differ-cmdline/ to run the application. The application must be compiled with Maven to the jar file before these can be run. Validation in run.sh and compare in run-two.sh. Edit the file and comment out the lines you don't want.
=======
   You can see a lot of examples of metadata extractor's outputs in a directory =examples=.
